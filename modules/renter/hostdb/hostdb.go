// Package hostdb provides a HostDB object that implements the renter.hostDB
// interface. The blockchain is scanned for host announcements and hosts that
// are found get added to the host database. The database continually scans the
// set of hosts it has found and updates who is online.

// TODO: There should be some mechanism that detects if the number of active
// hosts is low. Then either the user can be informed, or the hostdb can start
// scanning hosts that have been offline for a while and are no longer
// prioritized by the scan loop.

// TODO: There should be some mechanism for detecting if the hostdb cannot
// connect to the internet. If it cannot, hosts should not be penalized for
// appearing to be offline, because they may not actually be offline and it'll
// unfairly over-penalize the hosts with the highest uptime.
